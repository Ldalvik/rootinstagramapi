# HOW TO USE

To call the class instantiate Instagram in your main method

      Instagram i = new Instagram
        .username("YourInstagramUsername")
        .password("YourInstagramPassword");
        
Now you can call any of the methods that are working.

e.g.

      i.getAccount().getName(); //returns the signed in accounts full name
      i.editAccount().setName("Hello World!"); //changes the signed in accounts name to "Hello World!"
      etc..
